# 🗺️ Viet Nam Economic Dashboard (Post Provincial Merger Analysis)
## 👀 Project Overview
Dashboard analyzing economic indicators of provinces and cities in Vietnam after the administrative unit merger, aimed at comparing economic scale, population distribution, and development disparities between localities.

Disclaimer : All datasets and reports do not represent any institution comapny or country and is just a dummy dataset to demonstrate Excel capabilities.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was compiled and cleaned from two publicly available pages on Wikipedia. The data was manually extracted, combined, and structured into a single dataset for analysis.

During the data preparation process, several cleaning steps were performed, including removing duplicate records, standardizing column formats, and handling missing values. After cleaning, the data was organized into a structured table to support further analysis and visualization.

[List of regions of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Vietnam): Vietnam is commonly divided into three main regions: Northern, Central, and Southern Vietnam. These are further grouped into eight subregions such as the Red River Delta, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta, although alternative regional classifications may also exist.
