## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was compiled and cleaned from two publicly available pages on Wikipedia. The data was manually extracted, combined, and structured into a single dataset for analysis.

During the data preparation process, several cleaning steps were performed, including removing duplicate records, standardizing column formats, and handling missing values. After cleaning, the data was organized into a structured table to support further analysis and visualization.

These are further grouped into eight subregions such as the Red River Delta, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta, although alternative regional classifications may also exist.
